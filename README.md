# learn-sass-features
This repository is created to learn SASS features and keep the examples ready to recap fast and re-use in any other existing projects which I work on.

# Project Setup
I have used Grunt to make the watch and bundling from SASS to CSS.

# Installation
Run below command to install.
`npm install`

# Bootstrap/Build:
Run below command to keep editing in watch mode.

`npm start`
